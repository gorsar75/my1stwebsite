<H1>Frequently Asked Questions on W3</H1>An FAQ list is really a cop-out from
managed information. You should be able to find everything you want
to know by browsing from the WWW project page, as everything should
be arranged in a logical way. Here though are things which maybe didn't
fit into the structure, with pointers to the answers which maybe did. It's
an experiment, started May 92. The questioners are anonymous.
