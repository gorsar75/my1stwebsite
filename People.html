    <title>People involved in the WorldWideWeb project</TITLE>
    <H1>WWW people</H1>This is a list of some of those who have contributed to the
  <A HREF=TheProject.html>WWW project</A>,
    and whose work is linked into this web. Unless otherwise stated
    they are at CERN, Phone +41(22)767 plus the extension given below
    or look them up in the
  <A HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch./WHO>phone book</A> . Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland.
    See also: <A HREF=http://slacvm.slac.stanford.edu:80/FIND/wizards.html>Wizards at SLAC</A> .
    <H2>Eelco van Asperen</H2>Ported the line-mode browser the PC under PC-NFS; developed a curses
    version. Email: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.
    <H2>Carl Barker</H2>Carl is at CERN for a six month period during his degree course at
    Brunel University, UK.  Carl will be working on the server side, possibly
    on client authentication. Tel: 8265.  Email: barker@cernnext.cern.ch
    <H2>Tim Berners-Lee</H2>Currently in CN division. Before comming to CERN, Tim worked on, among
    other things, document production and text processing. He developped
    his first hypertext system, "Enquire", in 1980 for his own use (although
    unaware of the existence of the term HyperText). With a background
    in text processing, real-time software and communications, Tim decided
    that high energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN
    was an ideal site for the development of wide-area hypertext ideas.
    Tim started the
  <A HREF=TheProject.html>WorldWideWeb</A> project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the
  <A HREF=NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html>
    application on the NeXT</A> along with most of the communications software.
    Phone: 3755, Email: timbl@info.cern.ch
    <H2>Robert Cailliau</H2>Formerly in programming language design and compiler construction,
    Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when
    he designed and implemented a widely used document markup and formatting
    system. He ran CERN's Office Computing Systems group from 87 to 89.
    He is a long-time user of Hypercard, which he used to such diverse
    ends as writing trip reports, games, bookkeeping software, and budget
    preparation forms. When he is not doing WWW's public relations, Robert
    is contributing browser software for the Macintosh platform, and analysing
    the needs of physics experiments for online data access. Phone: +41
    (22) 767 50 05, Email: cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch
    <H2>Dan Connolly</H2>An early follower of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor
    for his company, and encouraged the use of proper SGML and MIME in
    the future. He wrote a
  <A HREF=MarkUp/HTML.dtd>DTD for HTML</A> and an
  <A HREF=Tools/HTMLGeneration/fix-html.pl>HTML legalizer</A> for old files.
    Email: connolly@pixel.convex.com.
    <H2>Peter Dobberstein</H2>While at the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE),  Peter did the port of the
    line-mode browser onto MVS and, indirectly, VM/CMS. These were the
    most difficult of the ports to date. He also overcame many incidental
    problems in making a large amount of information in the
  <A HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch/FIND/DESY?>DESY database</A>available.
    <H2>"Erwise" team</H2>Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd{nmaanlakka
    ('{' is 'a' with two dots above it.. we must get some character set
    description into HTML!)   (under the supervision of Ari Lemmke)  are
    "Erwise".  At Helsinki Technical University, they  are writing a Motif-based
    WWW browser (editor? we can hope...) for their undergraduate final
    year project. The team can be reached as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari
    as arl@cs.hut.fi.
    <H2>Alain Favre</H2>Alain is an undergraduate  working with ECP/PT on a browser for Windows
    on PCs. Phone: 8265, no email yet.  In CERN mostly in the afternoons.
    <H2>David Foster</H2>With wide experience in networking, and a current conviction information
    systems and PC/Windows being the way of the future, Dave is having
    a go at a MS-Windows browser/editor. Dave also has a strong interest
    in server technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.
    <H2>Jean-Francois Groff</H2>Provided some useful input in the "design issues". During his stay
    at CERN as "cooperant", J-F joined the project in September 1991.
    He wrote the
    <A HREF=VMSHelp/Overview.html> gateway to the VMS Help system</A> , worked on the new modular
    browser architecure, and helped support and present WWW at all levels.
    He is now porting the communications code to DECnet in order to set
    up servers for physics experiments.  JF now works for NeXT Europe
    but continues his interest in the web...(<A HREF=People/Groff.html> Contact</A> )
    <H2>Tony Johnson</H2>Tel: (415) 926 2278, TONYJ@scs.slac.stanford.edu.<P>

    SSC, etc. A SLAC server expert and a
    <A HREF=http://slacvm.slac.stanford.edu:80/FIND/wizards.html>WWWizard</A> .
    <H2>Paul Kunz</H2>Paul took the W3 word across to SLAC, installed the clients and inspired
    the setting up of servers by the
    <A HREF=http://slacvm.slac.stanford.edu:80/FIND/wizards.html>WWWizards</A> . Paul spreads enthusiasm
    for all sort of good ideas such as OO programming, NeXTs, etc...
    <H2>Willem van Leeuwen</H2>at NIKHEF, WIllem put up many
    <A HREF=http://nic.nikhef.nl./user/a03/www/default/NikhefGuide.html>servers</A> and has provided much useful
    feedback about the w3 browser code.
    <H2>Nicola Pellow</H2>With the project from November 1990 to August 1991, and October 1992
    to ??.  A graduate of Leicester Polytechnic, UK, Nicola wrote the
    original
    <A HREF=LineMode/Browser.html>line mode browser</A> .
    (<A HREF=People/Pellow.html> More </A> ) Nicola is now (Oct 92) working on the
    <A HREF=Macintosh/Status.html>Mac browser</A> .
    <H2>Bernd Pollermann</H2>Bernd is responsible for the "XFIND" indexes on the CERNVM node, for
    their operation and, largely, their contents. He is also the editor
    of the Computer Newsletter (CNL), and has experience in managing large
    databases of information. Bernd is in the AS group of CN division.
    He has contributed
    <A HREF=Status.html#17>code</A> for the FIND server which allows hypertext
    access to this large store of information. Phone: 2407, Office: 513-1-16,
    Email: bernd@cernvm.cern.ch
    <H2>Arthur Secret</H2>A student at CERN during August and September 1992,
    Arthur wrote the first
    <A HREF=Daemon/Oracle/Overview.html>W3-Oracle gateway</A> .
    <H2>Jonthan Streets</H2>Online Support group, FINAL. Jonathan put up a VMS server using DCL
    and later C. He helped debug the Mac browser.
    <H2>Pei Wei</H2>Pei is the author of " Viola", a hypertext browser, and the ViolaWWW
    variant which is a WWW browser. He was at the University of California
    at Berkeley, Experimental Computing Facility, now full time with O'Reilly
    and Associates, Sebastopol, CA, USA.  Email: wei@xcf.berkeley.edu
    <H2>Bebo White</H2>one of the

    Bebo enthusiastically spreads the word.
    During a short stay at CERN in summer '92, Bebo put up a number of
    servers for information from the Aleph experiment.
